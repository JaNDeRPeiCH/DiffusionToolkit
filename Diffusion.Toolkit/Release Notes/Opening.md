# Diffusion Toolkit

Are you tired of dragging your images into PNG-Info to see the metadata?  Annoyed at how slow navigating through Explorer is to view your images? Want to organize your images without having to move them around to different folders? Wish you could easily search your images metadata? 

Diffusion Toolkit (https://github.com/RupertAvery/DiffusionToolkit) is an image metadata-indexer and viewer for AI-generated images. It aims to help you organize, search and sort your ever-growing collection of best quality 4k masterpieces.

# Installation

### Windows

* If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, download and install the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/RupertAvery/DiffusionToolkit/releases/latest) 
    * Under the latest release, expand Assets and download **Diffusion.Toolkit.v1.9.0.zip**.
* Extract all files into a folder

### Linux / MacOS

An basic experimental version is available on the AvaloniaUI branch. It works, and is functional, but it is now outdated and lacks features due to some bugs I have experienced in Avalonia.  

No official build is currently available, and while it can build on MacOS, getting it to run as an App can be tricky.
